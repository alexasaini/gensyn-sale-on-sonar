$AI allocations are now live


Allocations reflect Testnet contribution across Swarm, BlockAssist, and CodeAssist, with emphasis on sustained, value-creating participation over time.

Contributions were measured using Honest Hours - verifiable activity that helped the network learn and operate more effectively, with additional weight given to direct human involvement where applicable.
